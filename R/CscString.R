Protocols such as telnet, VNC, RDP, or others that do not actively support strong encryption should only be used if they are performed over a secondary encryption channel, such as SSL, TLS or IPSEC."
csc3.5<-"Use file integrity checking tools to ensure that critical system files (including sensitive system and application executables, libraries, and configurations) have not been altered. The reporting system should: have the ability to account for routine and expected changes; highlight and alert on unusual or unexpected alterations; show the history of configuration changes over time and identify who made the change (including the original logged-in account in the event of a user ID switch, such as with the su or sudo command). These integrity checks should identify suspicious system alterations such as: owner and permissions changes to files or directories; the use of alternate data streams which could be used to hide malicious activities; and the introduction of extra files into key system areas (which could indicate malicious payloads left by attackers or additional files inappropriately added during batch distribution processes)."

First, personnel should verify that the activity of the regular vulnerability scanning tools  is itself logged.

Such acceptance of business risks for existing vulnerabilities should be periodically reviewed to determine if newer compensating controls or subsequent patches can address vulnerabilities that were previously accepted, or if conditions have changed, increasing the risk."

Disable such accounts if not needed, or document and monitor exceptions (e.g., vendor maintenance accounts needed for system recovery or continuity operations). Require that managers match active employees and contractors with each account belonging to their managed staff.

A second option is to have outside teachers provide training onsite so the examples used will be directly relevant. If you have small numbers of people to train, use training conferences or online training to fill the gaps."
csc17.3<-"Implement an security awareness program that (1) focuses only on the methods commonly used in intrusions that can be blocked through individual action, (2) is delivered in short online modules convenient for employees (3) is updated frequently (at least annually) to represent the latest attack techniques, (4) is mandated for completion by all employees at least annually, and (5) is reliably monitored for employee completion."

For applications that are not web-based, specific application firewalls should be deployed if such tools are available for the given application type.  If the traffic is encrypted, the device should either sit behind the encryption or be capable of decrypting the traffic prior to analysis.  If neither option is appropriate, a host-based web application firewall should be deployed."

csc18.6<-"Maintain separate environments for production and nonproduction systems. Developers should not typically have unmonitored access to production environments."

csc20.1<-"Conduct regular external and internal penetration tests to identify vulnerabilities and attack vectors that can be used to exploit enterprise systems successfully. Penetration testing should occur from outside the network perimeter (i.e., the Internet or wireless frequencies around an organization) as well as from within its boundaries (i.e., on the internal network) to simulate both outsider and insider attacks."
csc20.2<-"Any user or system accounts used to perform penetration testing should be controlled and monitored to make sure they are only being used for legitimate purposes, and are removed or restored to normal function after testing is over."
csc20.3<-"Perform periodic Red Team exercises to test organizational readiness to identify and stop attacks or to respond quickly and effectively."
csc20.4<-"Include tests for the presence of unprotected system information and artifacts that would be useful to attackers, including network diagrams, configuration files, older penetration test reports, e-mails or documents containing passwords or other information critical to system operation."
csc20.5<-"Plan clear goals of the penetration test itself with blended attacks in mind, identifying the goal machine or target asset.  Many APT-style attacks deploy multiple vectors—often social engineering combined with web or network exploitation.  Red Team manual or automated testing that captures pivoted and multi-vector attacks offers a more realistic assessment of security posture and risk to critical assets."
csc20.6<-"Use vulnerability scanning and penetration testing tools in concert.  The results of vulnerability scanning assessments should be used as a starting point to guide and focus penetration testing efforts."
csc20.7<-"Wherever possible, ensure that Red Teams results are documented using open, machine-readable standards (e.g., SCAP).  Devise a scoring method for determining the results of Red Team exercises so that results can be compared over time."
